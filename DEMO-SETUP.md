## Note on Sanity Studio

The Sanity Studio route (`/studio`) will still exist but won't function without proper Sanity credentials. This is intentional for the demo and can be re-enabled later by:

1. Creating a Sanity project at [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
2. Adding credentials to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
   ```
3. Reverting the changes to use the original Sanity queries

## Next Steps for Production

When ready to move from demo to production:

1. **Set up Sanity CMS** and restore original query functions
2. **Add Google Maps API** key for real map functionality
3. **Upload actual product images** and brand assets
4. **Configure real retailer locations** with accurate geocoding
5. **Set up analytics** (Google Analytics, Hotjar, etc.)
6. **Deploy to Vercel** or your preferred hosting platform
7. **Set up Sanity webhook** for automatic revalidation
